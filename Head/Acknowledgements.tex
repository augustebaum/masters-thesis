This project was very much facilitated by a number of people, and here are their well-deserved thanks.
Thank you to Prof.~Frossard from EPFL and to Dr Daniel Dobos from Swisscom AG for taking on the supervision of this project and for helpful comments.
Thank you to everyone at the Swisscom Digital Lab for welcoming me as an intern, and making me feel at home;
many thanks to all the other Master's students, especially Karim, Marie and of course Arnaud for well-deserved breaks and insightful discussions, often at the same time;
a special thank you to Vincent and Nati for their precious guidance on what it means to do research, and
a very large heart-shaped thank you to Constance, my parents and loved ones for engaging with me on my project, being there for me when I needed them, and always pushing me to take a step back and understand the ramifications of this research.

I wish you all the best.
