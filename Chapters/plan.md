    Hypothesis being challenged
    Trade-off considerations
    Details on experimental conditions like machine running the experiment
4. Results
  Plots, tables
    Think accessibility
      Big enough fonts
      No colors if possible
      One bit of information per plot
      Figure caption describes what is shown
    Highlight interesting poitns (e.g. bolden best line)
    Show if up is good or bad
  Explanations on the content of the plots and tables
5. Discussion
  Tentative Interpretation of results: 
    does the result challenge the corresponding hypothesis?
  Possible reasons for experiment results, and what that
    suggests for further research
  Limitations of the experiments
6. Conclusion
