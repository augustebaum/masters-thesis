- [x] Use different notation for gradient, partial and jacobian, or be more explicit
- [x] acronyms?
- [ ] graph for logprbothers

- [ ] Mention that my implementation of losses allows for differentiating between source and others

- [x] make u, p, L explicit (what variable do they take)
- [x] Move datasets and robustness to experiments
- [x] More structure in losses description:
    - [x] Give each loss a header
    - [x] Give the def again
- [x] In discussion, start with what i did
- [x] Methods: summarize what needs to be done at the start
